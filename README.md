# Warehouse - 3rd Year Computer Science Project
Hello! Warehouse is my short experience created to ask users about how they feel about immersion in Virtual Reality after a series of simple puzzles.
This application was developed over the course of 12 weeks for my course, and as such may be rough around the edges. Apologies in advance!
# A few things before you get started:
1. There is no sound in this application due to development time being so short! please feel free to put some music on and play through if you prefer.
2. This application does not have a pause menu or continue function! It's designed to be finished in one session, if you cannot finish the application due to bugs please message me ASAP and I will work to get the issue fixed!
3. Teleport Locomotion users, I apologise in advance for how rough around the edges the teleport is, I was unable to find a way to make the movement more comfortable in the time constraints.
4. You must be over 18 to take part in the study for my project! If you're under 18 you can give the application a go and give feedback but unfortunately you cannot participate due to ethical restrictions.
